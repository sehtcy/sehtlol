- Hi, I’m Seth. I'm a little new to computer science and I wanted to expand/sharpen my coding skills as well as troubleshooting. Currently, I have experience in Python which is my strongest language, but I know a few things about Java and C; MySQL database is also one of my strong spots too. On Github, I want to gain more project experience to at least get myself started. I may code on my free time or hopefully collab with other people.
